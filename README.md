# Road-Accident-Dashboard
Creating a Road Accident Dashboard in MS Excel with 3.07 million rows and 21 fields for the years 2021 and 2022 involves several steps to ensure the data is processed efficiently and the dashboard is insightful and interactive. Below is a brief overview of the process and key considerations:

## Data Preparation

#### 1. Data Cleaning:

- Ensure all fields are correctly formatted (e.g., dates, numerical values).
- Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
- Standardize categorical data (e.g., accident types, locations).
- 
#### 2. Data Segmentation:

- Split the data into manageable chunks if Excel’s row limit (1,048,576) is exceeded.
- Use Excel’s Power Query or Power Pivot to handle large datasets efficiently.
- 
#### 3. Key Fields:

- Date and Time of Accident
- Location (City, State, GPS coordinates)
- Type of Accident
- Severity (minor, major, fatal)
- Vehicles Involved
- Weather Conditions
- Road Conditions
- Casualties and Injuries
- Cause of Accident

## Dashboard Components

#### 1. Summary Statistics:

- Total number of accidents per year
- Monthly/quarterly trends
- Breakdown by severity and type of accident

#### 2. Interactive Charts and Graphs:

- Time series graphs for accident trends over 2021 and 2022.
- Heat maps to show accident density by location.
- Bar charts for causes of accidents.
- Pie charts for the distribution of accident severity.

#### 3. Filters and Slicers:

- Year and month
- Location
- Severity
- Weather and road conditions

#### 4. KPIs and Metrics:

- Average number of accidents per month
- Percentage increase/decrease in accidents year-over-year
- Average response time (if data available)
- Total casualties and injuries

## Implementation Steps

#### 1. Load Data into Power Query:

- Import data into Power Query for cleaning and transformation.
- Create relationships between different tables if necessary.

#### 2. Data Model in Power Pivot:

- Use Power Pivot to create a data model, enabling handling of large datasets.
- Create necessary measures and calculated fields.

#### 3. Building the Dashboard:

- Insert PivotTables and PivotCharts based on the data model.
- Design interactive elements such as slicers for filtering data.
- Format charts and tables for clear visualization.

#### 4. Optimization:

- Ensure that the dashboard is optimized for performance.
- Test the dashboard with various data queries to ensure it handles the large dataset efficiently.

## Deliverables

- Excel File with the Dashboard: Containing all the interactive elements, charts, and summary statistics.
- Documentation: Instructions on how to use the dashboard, update the data, and interpret the insights.
- Technical Support: Initial setup and ongoing support for any technical issues or updates.

## Key Insights

- Identifying high-risk locations and times for accidents.
- Analyzing the impact of weather and road conditions on accident frequency.
- Understanding the common causes of accidents to inform prevention strategies.
- Assessing trends in accident severity to allocate resources effectively.

By following these steps, the Road Accident Dashboard will provide valuable insights into accident patterns and help the client make informed decisions to enhance road safety.
